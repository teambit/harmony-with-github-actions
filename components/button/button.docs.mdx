### UX Guidelines

- Place buttons where you expect to find them. Do not force users to "hunt for buttons".
- Do not use generic labels for your buttons. Use verbs that clearly explain the button's function.
- Size buttons in proportion to their importance.

### Using the button component

Use the live playground below to learn how to use this component.

- Remove the `isLoading` prop to see the button as 'active'
- Add the `disabled` prop to see it disabled without indicating loading

```jsx live
<Button isLoading>Click here</Button>
```
